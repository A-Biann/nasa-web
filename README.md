# A Glance to A Long Life
## for 2022 NASA space apps challenge

### Project Summary
“Twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are”, a simple and well known melody depicting the sparkling stars hanging up in the late night sky and the phenomenon of constantly changing brightness of stars. Our task aims to provide an effective method helping them to learn the fundamental knowledge of the eternal life of the stars using nowadays internet’s trends like memes and funny gifs. For instance, we had collected several seasonal stars data and pictures using NASA’s open data and combined them into a meme-style gif. Finally, we organized them into a well designed web page guiding not only kids or teens but who admiring the same starry night sky.

### Hackathon Journey
During the experience, we worked as a team in order to come up with the idea to finish the project. We learned how to tackle problems and how to remain calm under pressure. Besides, we got more familiar with ReactJS after finishing the webpage.
It’s really interesting finding out how effective it is to teach people about astronomy using memes, which greatly bridges the gap between professionals and general people since memes usually contain plenty of background knowledge, and thus people are motivated to learn them in order to get the punchline.
